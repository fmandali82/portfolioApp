### Research Focus: Estimate the pose and velocity of the robot walking on a moving terrain
Duration : Jan 2025 - present

-   Learnt Lie Group theory to understand invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) theory.
-   Implemented a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09251" target="_blank" title="Click">contact-aided InEKF</a> on the Agility Robotics "Digit" humanoid robot using C++ and ROS2.
-   Assisting in conducting experiments on Digit by capturing ground truth data using VICON Motion Capture system, and simulating the moving terrain using the Motek M-Gait treadmill.

### Research Focus: Observe the ping pong ball and robot during play
Duration : July 2025 - present

-	Directed the efforts to design the entire perception module to faciliate observation for the Booster T1 robot to play ping pong.
-   Utilized two affordable RGBD cameras to track ping pong ball trajectory by undistoring the cameras and using the pinhole camera model. 
-   Produced the physical and VICON setup to get camera and robot observation during play.
-   Supervised the creation of ball detection model, communication between cameras data, VICON, and robot hardware. 
-   Tested the complete perception module to move the arm of the robot using a joint-PD controller to hit the incoming ball.
