## Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS)

The <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/EPICSlearning" target="_blank" title="Click">EPICS</a> community connects students with community partners to promote engineering for community service. I chose EPICS for my first-year engineering pathway, joining Team Global, which was created to accommodate students attending Purdue virtually from different cities worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**First Semester**: Project Archivist

As a Project Archivist for a playground design project for Habitat for Humanity's Lafayette, IN branch, I conducted research into safety regulations, potential land availability, and created 2D playground design plans. These plans were intended to help the organization secure funding and land approval. I ensured proper documentation of team efforts, references, and community partner requirements.

**Second Semester**: Project Manager

In my second semester, I was elected Project Manager for Team Global, overseeing three projects:

- The Habitat for Humanity playground design.
- Partnering with an NGO in Philadelphia to plan the use of solar energy for their office.
- Developing an automated system to analyze and categorize applicants to the EPICS learning community.

My responsibilities included managing weekly meetings for project updates, coordinating resources, consulting with advisors, performing documentation, and ensuring strong communication with community partners. My efforts earned me the Outstanding First-Year Student Award by EPICS.

This experience was a wholesome introduction to the essence of engineering: solving problems and helping people. It solidified my passion for pursuing a career in engineering.
