### Research Focus: Derive a data-driven model to simulate car motion and estimate its trajectory 

-	Developed a Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in MATLAB.
-	Modeled car motion using simulation data from an experiment conducted by Myeongkyu Lee, Graduate School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University.
-	Addressed the challenge of differentiating between desirable and undesirable samples by incorporating a Weighted EM algorithm, which allowed for controlling the influence of various data samples on the model behavior.
