## Spring 2024 Term (Jan 2024 – May 2024):
**Research Focus**: Data-Driven Modeling with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

-	Developed GMMs using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in MATLAB.
-	Modeled car motion using simulation data from an experiment conducted by Myeongkyu Lee, Graduate School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University.
-	Addressed the challenge of differentiating between desirable and undesirable samples by incorporating a Weighted EM algorithm, which allowed for controlling the influence of various data samples on the model behavior.
-	Documented the research in a technical paper written in Overleaf LaTeX.

**Research Goals**:

-	Create a model to replicate car motion using collected data.
-	Estimate the trajectory of a car under similar conditions using the developed model.

## Summer 2024 Term (June 2024 – present):

-	Collaborating with mentor Joonwon Choi to learn and implement ROS2, Gazebo, and PX4.
-	Developing a testing environment for drone research using Docker on a Linux computer.
