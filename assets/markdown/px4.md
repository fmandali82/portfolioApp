## Learning PX4/ROS2/Gazebo

Realizing the transformative potential of ROS2 and Gazebo for robot modeling and simulation, I am actively learning and integrating these platforms with PX4-Autopilot for software-in-the-loop (SITL) testing. Leveraging comprehensive documentation and tutorials like those from <a href="https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-simulate-a-robot-using-gazebo-and-ros-2/" target="_blank" title="Click"> Automatic Addison</a>, I've gained proficiency in controlling Gazebo models using ROS2. Despite using a Windows laptop, I optimized my environment by setting up a Docker container based on Ubuntu, enhancing the ease of running robot software applications. I have successfully initiated Gazebo simulations with PX4 SITL for drones, performed arming procedures, and developed ROS2 nodes to achieve basic drone movements and data acquisition. Moving forward, I am dedicated to advancing my skills across these software tools and focusing on implementing autonomous and control algorithms within the drone environment.
