## Summer 2022 Term:
**Research Focus**: Optimization of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) Device:

-	Participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.
-	Optimized the design of a TES device, part of a thermal management system (TMS) for aircraft electronics.
-	Analyzed and understood the TMS and TES simulation models created in MATLAB, distributed across different GitHub repositories.
-	Optimized TES device dimensions by simulating with the entire TMS, incorporating effects of the heat exchanger and water tank variations.
-	Employed various optimization algorithms from MATLAB’s Global Optimization Toolbox, identifying the most effective one.
-	Utilized MATLAB’s Parallel Computing Toolbox to expedite optimization by distributing computations across multiple cores.

**Key Findings**:

Demonstrated the significant difference in TES design optimization independently versus system-level, highlighting the superior performance of system-level optimization.

## Fall 2022 Term (Sept 2022 - Dec 2022):
**Extended Research**: Control Co-Design of Thermal Management System:

-	Continued research to perform a control co-design of the TMS.
-	Conducted sensitivity analysis on TES geometric parameters and controller parameters affecting heat load management performance.
-	Applied the developed optimization algorithm to determine optimal geometric and controller parameters for TES under constant and variable heat loads.
-	Compared TES designs from control co-design with those designed independently, showcasing enhanced performance in handling variable heat loads.

## Achievements:
-	Presented research at the iTherm 2023 IEEE conference.
-	Won the best poster award in the system-level thermal management track.
