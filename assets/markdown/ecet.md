# ECET 224: Electronic Systems

**Professor**: Dr. Zachary Schreiber

This foundational course for my minor in Electrical Engineering Technology provided an overview of key electrical and electronic systems. I learned electrical wiring and circuit design with both direct current (DC) sources and resistances, as well as alternating current (AC) sources, applications, and amplifiers. Additionally, I gained experience in connecting and controlling applications via a microcontroller (Atmel Mega 2560 on Arduino), including LEDs, motors, servos, MOSFETs, and solid-state relays. Weekly labs complemented classroom lectures, allowing me to apply my knowledge practically and use lab equipment such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, and soldering tools.

# ECET 179: Introduction To Digital Systems

**Professor**: Jeffery Richardson

Building on concepts from ECET 224, this course focused on enhancing my skills in using and applying microcontrollers, specifically the Atmel Mega 2560. I learned to utilize input and output (I/O) ports to connect with multiple components and facilitate data transmission. Through C programming, I developed logical algorithms to automate control of components such as stepper motors, music players, and keypads, and used a serial display monitor for data and comments. I also explored digital-to-analog conversion and employed microcontroller timers for pulse width modulation to control servos and measure signals. Weekly labs reinforced classroom lectures, allowing me to apply my knowledge practically and use lab equipment like oscilloscopes, multimeters, and soldering tools.
