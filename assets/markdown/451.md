## AAE 451 : Aircraft Design/Build/Fly

**Professor**: Dr. Leifur Leifsson

For my capstone project, our team of seven is tasked with designing a radio-controlled airplane that can be hand-launched, complete three laps, and belly land while carrying a specified payload, all while minimizing flight time. We are developing a single-propeller electric aircraft with a 5-foot wingspan, weighing a total of 7 pounds, and capable of carrying a 1-pound payload. As part of the aerodynamics and controls team, I am focusing on static and dynamic stability analyses to determine the appropriate sizing for the tail and control surfaces, including the elevators and rudders. Additionally, I have contributed to the initial sizing and weight estimation of the aircraft and conducted research on suitable servos for the control surfaces. We are currently in the design phase, and below is a glimpse of the CAD model of our airplane. Once the design is finalized, we will manufacture and fly the aircraft. Stay tuned for updates!
