To demonstrate my understanding, I collaborated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharva-gunda/" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn">Atharva Gunda</a> and  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hsin-ying-lin-94050a292/" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn">Hsin-Ying Lin</a> to simulate real-time trajectory optimization for a UAV maneuvering in an unknown environment. We utilized a nonlinear model predictive controller to optimize the control input for the UAV's lateral and longitudinal motion, with a satellite providing location data. An extended Kalman filter aboard the UAV predicted its next state and corrected its estimate using the satellite data. We successfully demonstrated the control and estimation of the UAV in three different environments: no obstacle, static obstacle, and dynamic obstacle. My contributions included assisting in the formulation and validation of linear and nonlinear dynamics, implementing the linear MPC, and formulating and implementing the EKF.

The following image shows how the drone trajectory (blue dots) avoids a static obstacle (purple sphere) to get to its destination.
