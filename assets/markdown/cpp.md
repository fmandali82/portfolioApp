## Learning C++ 

Realizing the potential of object orient programming in robotics, I learned C++ using 
<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/pages/syllabus/" target="_blank" title="Click"> MIT OpenCourseWare Intro to C++</a> course and using the lectures notes of ECE 39595 (Object Oriented Programming, OOP) taught in the electrical and computer enginereing department at Purdue University. I applied my knowledge by completing the projects for the ECE 39595 course, that included using C++ to create a linked list to store key-value information, designing a hash map for fast retrieval of key-value pairs, using class/method templates, and virtual methods/derived classes tto improve code usuabiltiy. I further implemented the concepts of OOP such as polymorphism and inhertance to create a very simplified computrized chess game with a rook, pawn, bishop, and king that check for valid moves in chess and visually displays the game. Finally, I created a C++ class to implement arithmatics operations on polynomials. Learning C++ helped me significantly in understanding and creating ROS2 nodes.
