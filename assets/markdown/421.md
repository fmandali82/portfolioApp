To demonstrate my understanding, I collaborated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharva-gunda/" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn">Atharva Gunda</a> to design a control algorithm for a vehicle (here, lighter than air blimp) so that it can correct its course automotically to track a different vehicle (target). The dynamic models of the blimp were given to us. I assisted in tuning and design of yaw/pitch/roll control and designing of the the simulink control model.
