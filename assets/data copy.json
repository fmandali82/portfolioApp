  "about": {
    "description": "Hey! I am a senior in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, graduating in December 2024. My journey through aerospace engineering and undergraduate research ignited a passion for Autonomy and Controls, driven by my early interest in programming for engineering projects. Hands-on experiences in manufacturing and design, coupled with learning electrical hardware and microcontrollers, led me to pursue a minor in Electrical Engineering Technology at Purdue University. Presenting at a prestigious conference and winning an award for my research reinforced my commitment to designing and implementing advanced control systems. My engineering education has taught me the importance of engineering, creating solutions for real-world problems. I am excited to contribute and learn from leading engineering companies as a controls/robotics engineer.",
